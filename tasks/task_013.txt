# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement World Simulator Core
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the core functionality for the World Simulator component.
# Details:
Implement WorldSimulator class. Create large-scale world management with chunk loading. Implement species introduction system. Add ecosystem dynamics (resource cycles, environmental pressures). Create long-term evolution tracking. Implement biome diversity. Add event system for significant ecosystem changes.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for large world creation and management. Verify chunk loading/unloading works correctly. Test species introduction and population tracking. Ensure resource cycles function as expected. Test long-term simulation stability. Verify biome-specific behaviors.
