# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Day/Night Cycle
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add a day/night cycle that affects creature behavior based on their activity cycle.
# Details:
Create a day/night cycle system that alternates between light and dark periods. Implement behavior modifications for nocturnal and diurnal creatures (activity levels, vision ranges, etc.). Add visual indicators for the current cycle state. Ensure the cycle affects the entire grid environment.

# Test Strategy:
Test behavior changes during cycle transitions. Verify that nocturnal and diurnal creatures behave appropriately during their active and inactive periods. Test edge cases like dawn and dusk transitions.
