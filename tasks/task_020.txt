# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Ecosystem Analytics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: low
# Description: Create the analytics system for tracking and visualizing ecosystem dynamics in the World Simulator.
# Details:
Implement species population tracking. Create biome health monitoring. Add resource distribution visualization. Implement predator-prey relationship tracking. Create extinction event detection. Add migration pattern analysis. Implement long-term trend visualization.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for population and resource tracking. Verify relationship detection correctly identifies patterns. Test trend analysis with simulated data. Ensure analytics don't impact simulation performance. Test with different ecosystem configurations.
