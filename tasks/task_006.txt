# Description: Enable creatures to eat other entities based on their diet type.
# Details:
Implement feeding mechanics based on creature diet types. Carnivores should eat other creatures, herbivores eat plants, and omnivores eat both.

# Test Strategy:
Test feeding behaviors for each diet type. Verify correct energy calculations. Test edge cases like starvation and overeating.
