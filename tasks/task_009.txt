# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Creature Sensory System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the sensory system for creatures to perceive their environment.
# Details:
Implement configurable vision range (3x3 to 7x7 grid). Create entity classification system (friend/enemy/food/obstacle). Implement distance encoding for detected entities. Add signal detection for communication. Create memory inputs for recent experiences. Integrate sensory processing with neural network inputs.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for different sensor configurations. Verify entity detection and classification. Test distance encoding accuracy. Ensure sensory inputs are correctly formatted for neural networks. Test with different world configurations.
