# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create Basic World Simulation Loop
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the core simulation loop that advances the world state over time.
# Details:
Create a simulation loop that updates the world state at regular intervals. Implement a time system (ticks/steps) for the simulation. Add functionality to start, pause, and reset the simulation. Ensure all entities can be updated each tick according to their behavior rules.

# Test Strategy:
Test simulation advancement through multiple ticks. Verify that entity states change appropriately over time. Test pause/resume/reset functionality.
