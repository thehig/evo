# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Basic Creature Class
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational Creature class with neural network integration, energy system, and basic actions.
# Details:
The Creature class has been successfully implemented with the following components:

1. **Core Files Created**:
   - src/core/creature-types.ts: Contains creature-specific types and interfaces (CreatureAction enum, ISensoryData, ICreatureState, IEnergyCosts, ICreatureConfig)
   - src/core/creature.ts: Main Creature class implementation
   - tests/unit/creature.test.ts: Comprehensive test suite

2. **Key Features Implemented**:
   - Neural Network Control: Creatures use neural networks to make decisions
   - Energy System: Configurable energy costs for actions, metabolic costs, energy clamping
   - Action System: Movement in 4 directions plus rest, with world boundary respect
   - Sensory Processing: Converts creature state to neural network inputs
   - Deterministic Behavior: Same neural network + same inputs = same actions
   - State Management: Tracks hunger, last action, action timing
   - Configuration: Flexible configuration system with defaults
   - Vision System: Basic vision grid implementation

3. **Remaining Tasks**:
   - Integrate Creature class with World simulation
   - Implement reproduction mechanics
   - Add more complex behaviors and interactions

# Test Strategy:
A comprehensive test suite has been implemented in tests/unit/creature.test.ts with 35 tests covering:
- Constructor and basic properties
- Energy system (clamping, death conditions, metabolic costs)
- Age and lifespan management
- Movement and action execution
- Neural network integration
- Deterministic behavior verification
- State management
- Lifecycle management
- Vision system
- Edge cases and configuration

All 35 creature tests are passing, confirming the implementation meets requirements. Future tests should focus on integration with the World class and more complex behaviors.
