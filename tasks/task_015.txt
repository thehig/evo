# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Save/Load System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Create functionality to save and load simulation states.
# Details:
Implement serialization of the entire simulation state, including grid, entities, and evolution history. Create file saving and loading functionality. Add options for saving at regular intervals. Implement validation to ensure loaded states are consistent.

# Test Strategy:
Test saving and loading with various simulation states. Verify that loaded simulations continue exactly as they were saved. Test with corrupted save files and edge cases.
