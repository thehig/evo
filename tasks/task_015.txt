# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Persistence System - World Snapshots
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the persistence system to handle complete world state snapshots.
# Details:
Implement WorldSnapshot serialization/deserialization. Create incremental snapshot system for efficient storage. Add snapshot metadata tracking. Implement snapshot validation and integrity checking. Create snapshot browsing and loading functionality. Add compression for large snapshots.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for world snapshot save/load operations. Verify incremental snapshots correctly capture changes. Test snapshot validation with corrupted data. Ensure large world snapshots can be efficiently stored and loaded. Test with different world configurations.
