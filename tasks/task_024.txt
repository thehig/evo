# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 13, 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize the simulation system for performance with large worlds and populations.
# Details:
Implement profiling for performance bottlenecks. Optimize neural network processing for batch operations. Add spatial partitioning for efficient entity queries. Implement multi-threading where beneficial. Create memory optimization for large worlds. Add configurable detail levels for performance tuning. Implement Windows-specific optimizations as specified in PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark performance before and after optimizations. Verify simulation can handle specified creature counts (100-500 for Training, 1000-10000 for World). Test memory usage with large worlds. Ensure optimizations don't affect simulation determinism.
