# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement ASCII Renderer
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a console-based ASCII renderer for text visualization of the simulation.
# Details:
Implement ASCIIRenderer class implementing IRenderer. Create character mappings for different entity types. Implement grid-based console output. Add color support where available. Create compact representation for large worlds. Implement basic animation for simulation progress.

# Test Strategy:
Manual testing of ASCII output for readability. Verify all entity types are distinguishable. Test with different world sizes. Ensure performance is acceptable for real-time visualization. Test on different console environments.
