# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement Persistence System - Neural Networks
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Extend the persistence system to handle neural network saving and loading.
# Details:
Implement neural network serialization/deserialization. Create file format for neural network weights and structure. Add compression for efficient storage. Implement batch operations for population saving/loading. Create neural network metadata storage. Add version compatibility for neural network files.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for neural network save/load operations. Verify serialization preserves all network properties. Test with different network architectures. Ensure compressed storage works correctly. Test backward compatibility with simulated older versions.
