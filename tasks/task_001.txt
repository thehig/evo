# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with TypeScript, Vite, and testing framework. Set up the basic folder structure following Windows conventions.
# Details:
Create a new project using Vite with TypeScript. Configure Vitest for testing. Set up comprehensive folder structure including src/ (with all module subdirectories: core, simulation, neural, genetic, world, persistence, renderer, types, utils, components), tests/ (with unit, integration, and fixtures subdirectories), and assets/ (with images, sounds, and data subdirectories). Configure TypeScript for Windows path conventions (backslashes) and CRLF line endings. Set up ESLint, .gitignore and comprehensive README.md. Create initial package.json with required dependencies. Implement module index files and main entry point.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully with 'npm run build'. Ensure TypeScript compiler options are correctly set for Windows environment with 'npx tsc --noEmit'. Confirm test runner works with test cases via 'npm run test:run'. Verify all directories and files are created correctly. Confirm Windows optimization with CRLF line endings and proper path handling.
