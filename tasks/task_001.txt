# Task ID: 1
# Title: Create Grid System Foundation
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the basic grid system that will serve as the environment for the evolution simulation.
# Details:
Create a 2D grid data structure with configurable dimensions. Each cell should be able to hold a single entity (creature, plant, rock, water, etc.). Implement basic grid operations like getting/setting cell contents, checking boundaries, and rendering the grid as pixels. Use a simple color mapping for different entity types.

# Test Strategy:
Unit test grid operations, boundary conditions, and rendering functionality. Verify grid initialization with various dimensions.
