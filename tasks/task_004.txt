# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Creature Movement System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Enable creatures to move around the grid based on their movement attributes.
# Details:
Add movement capabilities to creatures based on their seed-derived movement speed. Implement different movement patterns (random, directed, etc.). Handle collision detection with grid boundaries and other entities. Movement should respect the grid's discrete nature, moving one cell at a time.

# Test Strategy:
Test movement in all directions, boundary collisions, and movement speeds. Verify that movement patterns match the expected behavior based on creature attributes.
