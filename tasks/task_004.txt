# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Genetic Algorithm Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the genetic algorithm system for evolving neural networks through selection, mutation, and crossover.
# Details:
Implement GeneticAlgorithm class with configurable parameters. Create selection mechanisms (tournament, roulette wheel). Implement mutation with configurable rates and magnitudes. Implement crossover methods (single-point, multi-point). Create fitness evaluation framework. Support for elitism to preserve top performers.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for selection, mutation, and crossover operations. Verify population statistics tracking. Test convergence on simple test problems. Ensure deterministic behavior with fixed random seeds.
