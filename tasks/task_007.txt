# Title: Implement Persistence System - Core
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational save/load system for storing and retrieving simulation data.
# Details:
Implement IPersistenceManager interface. Create directory structure as specified in PRD (C:\SimData\...). Implement file format specifications for JSON and binary data. Add checksum verification for data integrity. Create version tracking for backward compatibility. Implement basic save/load operations for core objects.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for saving and loading different object types. Verify checksum validation works correctly. Test file structure creation. Ensure Windows path conventions are followed. Test with corrupted files to verify error handling.
