# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Creature Reproduction System
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the ability for creatures to reproduce and create offspring.
# Details:
Add reproduction mechanics for creatures. Implement conditions for reproduction (energy threshold, nearby mate, etc.). Create offspring generation logic that combines parent traits according to dominance rules. Position offspring near parents on the grid. Include energy cost for reproduction.

# Test Strategy:
Test reproduction triggers, offspring trait inheritance, and positioning. Verify energy costs and population growth rates.
