# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Neural Network Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the neural network implementation that will control creature behavior with configurable input/hidden/output layers.
# Details:
Implemented NeuralNetwork class with configurable architecture (input size, hidden layers, output size). Added support for sigmoid and ReLU activation functions with proper mathematical implementation. Implemented forward propagation for deterministic behavior. Created multiple weight initialization strategies including Default, Xavier, and He initializers with configurable ranges. Implemented bias neurons with configuration options. Ensured all operations are deterministic with proper seed handling. Added comprehensive state management with serialization/deserialization support.

# Test Strategy:
Created comprehensive test suite with 36 tests covering activation function correctness, weight initializer behavior, network construction, forward propagation with different architectures, deterministic behavior verification, state management, and bias neuron functionality. All 96 tests passing.
