# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Neural Network Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the neural network implementation that will control creature behavior with configurable input/hidden/output layers.
# Details:
Implement NeuralNetwork class with configurable architecture (input size, hidden layers, output size). Support for sigmoid and ReLU activation functions. Implement forward propagation for deterministic behavior. Create weight initialization with configurable ranges. Implement bias neurons. Ensure all operations are deterministic.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for forward propagation with known inputs and weights. Verify deterministic behavior - identical inputs produce identical outputs. Test different network configurations and activation functions.
