Based on your current implementation with Vitest and existing directory structure, here's additional information to enhance your test framework:

```
## Enhancing Existing Test Framework

### Test Utilities Improvements
1. Create a `utils/` directory with specialized helpers:
   - `mockServices.ts` - Factory functions for consistent service mocking
   - `testDataGenerators.ts` - Functions to generate test data with proper typing
   - `assertionHelpers.ts` - Custom matchers for common application-specific assertions

### Environment Configuration
1. Implement `vitest.config.{env}.ts` files for different environments:
   - Configure timeouts appropriate for each test type (shorter for unit, longer for integration)
   - Set up environment-specific mocking strategies
   - Add conditional coverage thresholds based on test type

### Documentation Enhancements
1. Create a `TESTING.md` file documenting:
   - When to use each test directory (unit/, integration/, etc.)
   - Mocking conventions and best practices
   - Guidelines for test naming and organization
   - Instructions for running specific test suites

### CI/CD Integration
1. Configure test matrix in CI to run different test types with appropriate settings:
   - Unit tests on every PR
   - Integration tests on merge to development
   - Full test suite including performance tests on release branches

### Performance Testing Setup
1. Add performance testing utilities:
   - Setup benchmark baselines
   - Implement performance regression detection
   - Configure Vitest for proper performance measurement

2. Create `tests/determinism/seed-management.ts`:
   - Functions to record and replay random seeds
   - Serialization/deserialization of simulation state for comparison
   - Hash verification of simulation states across runs

### Performance Testing Framework
1. Implement `tests/performance/benchmarks/`:
   - `neural-network-throughput.bench.ts`: Measures neural network processing speed
   - `world-update-performance.bench.ts`: Benchmarks world tick performance with varying entity counts
   - `memory-consumption.bench.ts`: Tracks memory usage patterns during long simulations

2. Add `tests/performance/regression-detection.ts`:
   - Statistical analysis tools to detect performance regressions
   - Baseline comparison utilities with configurable thresholds
   - Performance trend visualization helpers

### Edge Case Testing
1. Create `tests/edge-cases/`:
   - `extreme-population.test.ts`: Tests with unusually large or small populations
   - `resource-scarcity.test.ts`: Simulations with limited resources
   - `neural-network-complexity.test.ts`: Tests with extremely complex neural architectures

### Test Data Management
1. Implement `tests/utils/simulation-snapshots.ts`:
   - Functions to capture and restore complete simulation states
   - Versioned test data storage for regression testing
   - Diff utilities to analyze behavioral changes between versions
