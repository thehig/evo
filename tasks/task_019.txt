# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Training Analytics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: low
# Description: Create the analytics system for tracking and visualizing evolutionary progress in the Training Simulator.
# Details:
Implement generation tracking with statistics. Create behavior analysis tools. Add performance metrics collection (survival rates, energy efficiency, reproduction). Implement neural network visualization. Create export functionality for analytics data. Add real-time monitoring during simulation.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for statistics collection and calculation. Verify visualization correctly represents neural networks. Test export functionality with different data formats. Ensure real-time monitoring doesn't impact simulation performance.
