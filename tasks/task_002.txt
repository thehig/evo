# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Basic Entity System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational entity system for all objects that can exist in the grid world.
# Details:
Design an entity base class/interface with common properties (position, type). Create derived types for inorganic entities (rocks, water) and organic entities (plants, creatures). Each entity should be represented by a single pixel with a specific color. Implement basic entity placement and removal from the grid.

# Test Strategy:
Test entity creation, placement on grid, and type identification. Verify correct visual representation of different entity types.
