# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Core Simulation Engine Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Define the core interfaces and abstract classes for the simulation engine that will be used by both Training and World simulators.
# Details:
Create interfaces for: ISimulationEngine, IWorld, IEntity, ICreature. Implement tick-based processing system with configurable tick rate. Define event system for simulation events. Create deterministic random number generator with seed support for reproducibility. Implement basic simulation loop with start/pause/stop functionality.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for deterministic behavior - given the same seed, simulation should produce identical results. Test tick processing and event propagation. Verify simulation control functions (start/pause/stop).
